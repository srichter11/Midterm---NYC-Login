# Midterm---NYC-Login
An app that shows useful city details for my neighborhood

This is an app that uses a zipcode input to show some custom information about a neighborhood. It uses maps, networking, table views, and a numbe of other elements to show real time data. 
The app saves the zipcode info in NSuserdefaults and deploys that data point throughout to customize the information shown.

The key APIs / data sources are: meetup, foursquare, nyc open data, 311 api, and 596 acres.
