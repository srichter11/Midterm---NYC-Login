# Midterm---NYC-Login
An app that shows useful city details for my neighborhood
//

This is the start of a longer more complex app that shows useful city details by neighborhood. 

It starts with a login, where the user can also create an account. In the absense of a backend, the app shows some alert messages when account info isn't input properly, but lets the user login anyway. 

The following screen starts the prototype of the interface for a particular neighborhood, which in a more complex version, would be customized based on zipcode. 

It then uses a table view to allow a user to select from a number of relevant options. The following screens show sample content, but are placeholder for a more dynamic app that would be customized with a backend based on the zipcode information. 

I also tried some new elements here like the blurr view style and customizing colors / borders / radius for my buttons. 

I integrated many of the things we've learned from class including table view, scroll view, modal presentation, navigation controllers, etc. 

For my final project, i wish to take this app forward with backend capabilites as well as integration with maps and other useful web-based tools.
